# Workers

The application consists of 1 activity that controls the fragments.
The first fragment provides professions.
After choosing a profession, a second fragment is launched with the names and surnames of employees.
When you click on an employee in the list, the third fragment is launched, which shows the avatar and detailed information on the selected employee.
